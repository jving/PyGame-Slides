# Slides in Pygame?
YES! It is possible!

I thought of this as I though of a game called "presentation roulette". So hopefully will this work.

# How do I use it?
* Markdown synatx
* Very rendering
* Much slides
<!-- transition: 3d-rotate -->

# Can I use tables?
<!-- transition: 2d-rotate -->
We try:
| Month    | Savings |
| -------- | ------- |
| January  | $250    |
| February | $80     |
| March    | $420    |

## Not yet.
I might do a pull-request to pygame_markdown when I get around to it.

# Transitions
* Is awesome!
## What?
* 3d-rotate (will fallback to 2d if gfx not available)
* 2d-rotate
* 3d-zoom
* fade
* slide (standard)
## How to
set in  `<!-- transition: -->` 
<!-- transition: fade -->

# Thank you!
<!-- transition: 3d-zoom -->
